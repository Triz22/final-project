## UX

Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'AnimeWorld' are:

* is inclusive of all age groups however targets the younger demographic between 12-18
* everyone who is looking for new animes to watch.
* people who like to talk about their experience with others
  
These users will be looking for:

* An fun website, with information allowing them to further explore their interests supported by the opinions of others
* A website that clearly displays the range of animes being watched by the community
* Ability to make a user account in order to interact with the site content
* Ability to post, comment and like posts
* This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and conformability of use.
